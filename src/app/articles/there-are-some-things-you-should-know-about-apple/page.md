Apple is not your friend. While they do a number of terrible things that a company worth a trillion dollars will do, they undeniably provide some value in the process. Some assorted thoughts:

* Their user experience has been a little shaky since Steve, but they are still the best in the business. There is no possible way you can use an Android device and then an iPhone and tell me the difference isn't [night and day](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/t6hr5l/i_switched_from_android_to_ios_and_the_user/). A huge reason for this is their tight software/hardware integration.
* [They used blood tantalum](https://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/13/where-apple-gets-tantalum-your-iphone-304351.html). I found out about this when researching a material for my wedding ring. Tantalum, known for its hardness and corrosion resistance, is used in your iPhone and was sold by refineries and smelters in the DR Congo to Apple to finance things Apple's customers wouldn't be too thrilled about. Yeah, and it's also what my wedding ring is made out of, whoops.
* Apple Support may have a file on your purchase history. I was on the phone with a "level 3" support tech (I don't know, it took me a while to get to him, and it seemed like he really knew something) to handle something with one of my iDevices when he said something to the effect of: "Don't worry Mr. Jafari, I see you're an important customer for us, we'll get this taken care of for you." Total speculation, but that's how it felt.
* They don't care about your finals. Around May 2006, during my time at NYU, I was in training to work at the then just-opening 5th Avenue flagship Apple retail store. They had this super intense orientation hosted at, I want to say, Radio City Music Hall, but that's not quite right... some other big theatre, I think in midtown. Anyway, it was all day, every day for a week, during my finals. I went to my supervisor and said, "Hey, can I get a day to study?" The answer was a short and firm "no," and I was let go on the spot. LOL. The enormous training manual they provided us was filled to the brim with interesting Apple stuff, like: if you want to say "unfortunately" to a customer, don't. Say "as it turns out" instead.
* Their track record on "right to repair" is super fishy. The long and short of it is they've changed their tune, a little bit, but you can see right through it. It's kind of like a drug that is illegal until someone in government can find a way to get their cut off its sales. I used to live down the block from [this guy's shop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w), who can fill you in a bit more.
* Working until 4 am is a badge of honor. At first, various random rumors I heard on the internet, then confirmed by a friend of a friend who works there. Apple isn't a place you stay for a long time, just to put a few years on the resume.

I'll try and keep this updated with some more thoughts as they come to me, but for now, I've got to run.
