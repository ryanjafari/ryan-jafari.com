description: It’s been a wild few years – we welcomed our little girl into the world, dove into the chaos of renovating our first house, and faced some really tough times, including a wake-up call about my health. It’s been a mix of amazing moments and real challenges, and I’ve learned a ton about myself that I already knew. The story so far...

A few years back, life was pretty sweet. My wife and I were living it up in a great apartment, not far from where we are now. Everything was just right – nice place, cool stuff, top-notch amenities. We were the picture of happiness: healthy, in love, and both gainfully employed. But as life tends to do, things started to shift.

Around the same time, we dove headfirst into buying a house. Talk about uncharted territory... It was a whirlwind of financial strains and renovations, transforming an old house into our home. We put down a lot of money, navigating this totally new and unprecedented journey. And yeah, the timing? It was intense. We were right in the thick of it, with our baby girl on the way. I remember we had her in the apartment, and shortly after she was born, we moved into the house. From baby steps to big leaps, it was change after change. Crazy times, for sure.

The year was probably 2019. We were buzzing with excitement over a planned trip to London with our best friends (my cousin and his wife) and the recent news of expecting our baby girl. This getaway was supposed to be a refreshing break from some tough times at work. Little did we know, COVID-19 was about to turn everything on its head.

Returning from our trip, we were met with a heart-wrenching situation. Two family friends, who were the parents of my wife's friend, passed away. It was a shock that rippled through our circle, deeply affecting their own children and leaving a profound impact on all who knew them. For us, it was a somber reminder of life's fragility, particularly poignant as we were expecting our baby. The pandemic, with its enforced isolation, only added to the complexity of mourning and supporting each other from a distance.

Life became a strange mix of new joys and unexpected struggles. Our daughter was born amidst this chaos, bringing light to our days, yet we couldn't even let her grandparents hold her, fearing for their health. We managed, thanks to our supportive family, but those early days were tough.

Then there was me, personally. I've always been the fit guy – the high school athlete, the college gym rat. But during COVID, I let things slide. Gym membership canceled, wine almost every night – what else was there to do, right? The weight crept up on me, and one day, my doctor called me "obese." That was a wake-up call.

I realized I'd lost touch with the things that made me, well, me. Fitness, for one. Remember Daniel Craig as James Bond in one of his first couple of movies? There's this scene where, after being out of action for a while, he's portrayed as the 'old dog' getting back into the game. It’s day one of his training, and he’s already in incredible shape. When he takes his shirt off, he's nothing short of shredded. Watching that, I couldn't help but think, 'Wow, what am I doing with myself?' It was a real eye-opener and a clear signal that it was time for me to make a change.

Here's where I'm at now: Mornings start early, with a cold shower that really wakes me up, and then I'm straight into downing water and a protein shake. Hitting the gym has become a regular thing for me. It's not just about lifting weights; it's about getting back to feeling good, both physically and mentally. Therapy's been a game changer too. Honestly, I'm in a much better place than I ever was. All these changes started with a few hard truths that got me moving in the right direction.

I see a lot of folks stuck in the same rut I was in, and believe me, I get it. It's like being in quicksand – the harder you try to get out, the deeper you sink. Breaking free is tough, really tough. But you know what sometimes helps? That jolt of harsh reality, an honest truth that pulls you out of that mire. For me, it was a no-nonsense talk with my doctor. It hit hard, but it was exactly what I needed. I'm thankful for it every day. And for you? That yank might be something totally different. The point is, it's out there, and when it hits, it can be a real game changer.

So, here's to change, to growth, and to finding the best version of ourselves. It's a journey, but man, is it worth it. Stay strong, stay positive, and remember: it's never too late to turn things around.

Be good, everyone.
