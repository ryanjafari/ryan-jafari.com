While my first Apple product was a Macintosh back in the day, fooling around with games the likes of Math Blasters and Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego, my first modern purchase was the PowerBook G4 17" in 2004.

We won't speak about the amount of days I spent running World of Warcraft on it.

This was a time, in college, where I just wanted the coolest, most expensive gadgets. Exactly the same as now, lol. And holy moly the privilege, it was on my parents' dime as I brazenly exploited the boomer's ([more on them later]()) quest to "provide the best for their kids". Which is not the same as now. This face: ðŸ˜….

I'm out of time, but:
