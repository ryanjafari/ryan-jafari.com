**Introduction:** In the dynamic world of blogging, efficiency is key. Automation can be a game-changer, and GitHub Actions offers a powerful tool for automating workflows. In this post, we'll explore how to use GitHub Actions to automate the process of detecting new blog posts and sending notifications to subscribers.

**Detecting New Blog Posts:** Our journey starts with setting up a GitHub repository for a Next.js blog where posts are stored as MD/MDX files. We use GitHub Actions to trigger a workflow on every push to the main branch. The key here is a custom script that checks for new or updated blog files. If it finds changes, it extracts relevant details like the post title, summary, and URL.

**Integrating Email Notifications:** With post details in hand, the next step is to send out email notifications. We integrate with ConvertKit's API for this purpose. By securely storing our API key in GitHub Secrets, we can ensure our workflow has the necessary access while keeping sensitive information safe. The script constructs an email for each new post and sends it to the subscriber list through ConvertKit.

**Refining the Workflow:** To keep our workflow manageable, we delve into best practices like using environment variables for API endpoints, modularizing with external scripts, and efficiently passing data between workflow steps. These practices help maintain readability and make our workflow more robust.

**Conclusion:** Automating blog updates with GitHub Actions not only saves time but also ensures consistency in how and when subscribers are notified. It's an excellent example of how automation can streamline content management processes in the world of blogging.
